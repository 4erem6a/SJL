# Sample JVM Language
Sample JVM JIT compiler for a sample language created for educational purposes.
# A few examples:
```
# Sample "Hello, world!" program:
println "Hello, world!"
```
```
# Some math & variables:
$x = 10
$y = 3.14
println $x * ($y + ($x / -$y))
```
```
# Some user input:
$i = input
print $i; " * "; $i; " = "; $i * $i; 10
```
```
# Some explicit typings
$a : number             # = 0
$b : string             # = ""
$c : string = $b + $a   # = "0"
```
